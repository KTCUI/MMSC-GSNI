**INTRODUCTION**

MMSC-GSNI is a modified method of similarity construction and the Gaver-Stehfest numerical inversion (MMSC-GSNI) algorithm program for solving fractal composite reservoir seepage model with polynomial type elastic outer boundary conditions.

The projection contains 12 files:posimn.m, beat1.m, epsilon.m, CDE2S.m, lambda.m, r1.m, RD.m, sigma.m, df1.m, df2.m, theta1.m, theta2.m. 

posimn.m is a function file, the function is 

where,  and  <a name="_ref127871120"></a>represent the initial and secondary categories of altered Bessel functions of order , respectively. This function is mainly used to simplify the expression of bottomhole pressure in in fractal composite reservoir seepage model with polynomial type elastic outer boundary conditions.

beat1.m, epsilon.m, CDE2S.m, lambda.m, r1.m, RD.m, sigma.m, df1.m, df2.m, theta1.m and theta2.m are all command files. Their main purposes are to use MMSC-GSNI algorithm to obtain non-dimensional bottomhole pressures and their derivatives in fractal composite reservoir seepage model with polynomial type elastic outer boundary conditions under different quadratic pressure gradients , non-dimensional elasticity , non-dimensional parameter cluster , non-dimensional coefficient , non-dimensional inner radius , non-dimensional outer radius , non-dimensional parameter , non-dimensional fractal dimensions  and , non-dimensional fractal indexes  and . 

**TEST DATA**

Command files beat1.m, epsilon.m, CDE2S.m, lambda.m, r1.m, RD.m, sigma.m, df1.m, df2.m, theta1.m and theta2.m already contain test data, which can be directly run to obtain test results.
